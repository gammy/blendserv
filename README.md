# blendserv
A simple webserver for controlling a red flash siren("saftblandare"), and a few accompanying clients; one CLI, one GUI.
`blendserv` doesn't need a special client however. It's just a basic web server listening on port 8192, which accepts
`plain` authenticated `POST` commands to set the blender state.
